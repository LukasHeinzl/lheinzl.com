        As by the spirit of the new "general" category, here is another (hopefully shorter) post about the recent
        happenings.
        My plan, in <i>general</i> (get it??) is to write shorter posts in the general category whenever enough
        interesting things have happened recently, while longer, more in-depth, mental health posts will follow in the
        future, covering longer time periods.
        And since its been a bit over two months now and things definitely happened, here we go.

        You may remember that last time I shed some light on my, let's say, questionable experiences with love.
        Well, I'm happy to report that things have changed for the better.
        No, I'm not in a relationship, don't get your hopes up, assuming you were rooting for me.
        The main person mentioned in the last general post and I actually had a talk.
        Well, we need to backtrack a bit actually.
        First of all, I made the spontaneous decision to buy tickets for a festival in my home town.
        If been there last year for one of the three days and it was incredible (<a
            href="/blog/2023-04-23-mental16">16. Things are looking up</a>).
        So, even though there weren't any artists that I absolutely had to see, there were at least a few that I was
        interested in.
        Long story short: Best decision to go.
        On the first day, in the early afternoon, I got a text from the person mentioned previously.
        In short, it was more of a heated / emotional message and the details don't matter right now, but we ended up
        meeting the monday after the festival.

        So, it's monday morning and I am still in the festival high.
        At first I felt a bit nervous, but overall I was just in too much of a happy "everything is a-ok" mood.
        We talked for about an hour and basically came to the conclusion that we were both interested in building up our
        friendship again.
        Yes, things had happened in the past and they were <i>far</i> from great, but we both agreed that we've learned
        from that and that there is a way to move forward.
        Over the next few days and weeks we talked a lot more about how we felt and also what boundaries we had.
        Overall, the importance of open communication was stressed a lot and we have been doing an okay job at it.
        I do believe that there is room for improvement, and I am referring quite a lot to myself here, but not
        exclusively.
        We will see how things go, only time will tell.

        Starting my masters degree has been really great so far.
        However, the first two days were quite overwhelming because there were many new people.
        And, despite the fact that <i>nameless person from above</i> and I get along again, it was strange and a bit
        awkward and uncomfortable to see the old group back together again.
        Because of a lot of stress at work, I actually had a rough time again briefly and even a small breakdown where
        I came home in the evening and just went sobbing into my pillow.
        Not a great time...

        Last part, ending on something positive >:)
        I've known someone for about a year now, because we sort of work together, but we haven't really talked much
        until now.
        So, I randomly decided to text them and ask if they wanted to hang out.
        After a few, at least for me, awkward texts back and forth we agreed to meet up.
        And now I can say that I have extended my very small circle of friends by one awesome person.
        We've met up a few times now and it's been really great.
        Now, really onto the last thing to say.
        At the time of writing this, last friday (October 6th) was a great day in the world of music.
        Two of my favorite artists released new albums / songs and I am so happy about it.
        I've been listening to them non-stop and I am not even close to being tired of them.
        First: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck9_Fx5DSz4">Normal People Things by Lovejoy (Single,
        Youtube)</a>.
        And second: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4KAtLRVIfB0bKnRY01dveY">
        Lucid Dreams by BoyWithUke (Album, Spotify)
    </a>.
        My personal shout-out and recommendation at the very end:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giisqo8JZQ8">Bad Things</a> really stood out to me.
        It's basically about the singer being in a bad mental state in general, but having someone close who comforts
        them.
        That really speaks to me, even-though I do not have that someone on my side.
        Anyway, go listen to these amazing songs and have a nice time :)
