        It's been a while...
        Three months to be exact.
        And a <em>lot</em> has happened in these three months.
        This post serves as a small summary of what I've been up to, as well as a small update on the future of this
        blog.
        It'll be split into three parts and we're starting it off with something positive.
    </p>

    <p>
        I successfully graduated from university and can now call myself a <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong>.
        Initially, I was quite worried about my thesis and the exam itself but in the end it all went well.
        Why was I worried?
        You'll find out in the next part of the post.
        For now though, we'll stick to some more positive news.
        While writing this I'm starting my full-employment at my university.
        I'll continue working in the Lab Services team, which I am very thrilled about.
        Also, my dream come true: I will be teaching software development in the upcoming semester.
    </p>

    <p>
        On another note:
        July has been quite a pleasant month for a change.
        After finishing my studies I had a month of downtime before starting to work.
        I used this time to relax and do some things I've been wanting to do for a while.
        For example:
        I started playing more games again and one that I've been looking forward to released mid-july.
        If you want to experience a cool new mechanic in a puzzle game, then I highly recommend to check out
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/">Viewfinder</a>.
        Although I think that it was a bit short and the story a bit of an add-on, I still really enjoyed it!
        Furthermore, I reworked my website a bit internally.
        You can now click the tags in the post list to filter for posts with that tag.
        I also tweaked the tags a bit so that the filter-system actually is useful.
        And, of course, I added my shiny new title to my name on the landing page <strong>&gt;:)</strong>
        Lastly, I've been on holiday, but more on that at the end of the post.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, let's get to the not so positive part.
        There have been some major, let's say, "happenings" in my life.
        Contrary to most other posts on here, what I'm writing about isn't in the past but still ongoing.
        Therefore, I won't go that much into detail, since I have no clear view on the situation myself.
        Also, I'm not on speaking terms with the people involved and it would feel wrong to write about them in detail.
        But, to the best of my ability, I'll try to summarize what happened, since this helps me to sort things out in
        my head.
    </p>

    <p>
        As hinted towards in my last post <a href="/blog/2023-05-04-mental17/">17. The birds and the bees</a> I've
        been in the closest friendship I've ever had.
        And, I've developed feelings for someone.
        All the details will, someday, be revealed in a future post.
        For now, I'll just say that things haven't worked out, in multiple ways.
        Needless to say, not only did the relationship not work out, I've also lost my closest friend.
        It's been a very difficult time since the end of May but things have thankfully gotten a lot better.
        While this alone seems rough, there's actually a catch.
        For the first time in my life, someone else has stated that they have feelings for me.
        What started out as a very close friendship slowly developed into more.
        However, there sort of was a mutual denial of the situation and we just kept telling each other that what we are
        doing is just platonic.
        Eventually, we actually stated our mutual feelings and even kissed.
        So, I guess at least I can now say that I experience my first kiss.
        What followed, however, was not so pleasant...
    </p>

    <p>
        Through details that I won't go into right now, things didn't work out.
        After some days after the kiss I've made a very difficult decision: I've ended the friendship.
        We were forced to see each other for a few more days until the month was over due to other reasons.
        That wasn't easy.
        I was extremely hurt and in pain and completely overwhelmed by my emotions.
        In this state, I've made a lot of mistakes and stupid decisions.
        I've hurt people that I care about and I've hurt myself.
        The latter not only emotionally but also physically, for the first time ever.
        Not my proudest moment.
        I haven't done it since and I don't plan to do it again.
        It's not worth harming yourself - I've learned that the hard way.
    </p>

    <p>
        There have been a couple more back and forths with the person in question.
        In a way of trying to get closure, or trying to get back the close friendship we had, I just made things worse.
        It's kinda like burning down a bridge and then throwing dynamite down the chasm, just to be extra sure that it
        won't get rebuilt.
        Right now, I have no idea what they are thinking about me.
        For all I know, they might as well just be done with me for good and hate me.
        Which is a very sad thought, since I do believe that we had a special friendship, even though things did not
        work out.
        There were some things that needed improvement in our friendship, but I think that we could have worked on them.
        I know (or at least strongly assume) that no-one involved acted in bad faith.
        And I know that it was (and still is) an extremely difficult situation for everyone involved.
        Yet, it is still difficult to get over the pain and forgive them.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's something I struggle with in general, though.
        Even the smallest argument, where we part ways in a bad mood, is something that I have a hard time getting over.
        The next time I'd see that person they would be fine again while my brain is still stuck on the negative.
        I'm always wondering if they are still mad at me or hate me.
        In regard to the current situation, I just wish that I could have handled it better.
        But, as always, I cannot change the past, only learn from it.
        There hasn't been a single day that I haven't thought about them or what happened.
        I miss them - or at least I think so.
        I am unsure if miss them or just the idea of having someone this close.
        Again, I do think that we had a special friendship and connected quite deeply and had a lot of understanding for
        each other.
        But right now there are too many open questions and no answers in sight.
        It needs more time, that's for sure.
        Maybe having a small talk would help, but I am not too sure about that as it could just make things worse.
        Or I could get my answers of not being welcomed at all anymore.
        But I have to look on the bright side and just make the best of the situation.
        It did spark the idea for two new songs as well, so there is always something positive to look at.
        Which leads me to the last part of this post.
        Again, more details and a more in-depth analysis of the situation will follow in a future post, once I've had
        more time to process everything.
        And, once the people in question would be ok with me writing this, since some of the details are <em>very</em>
        personal.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, what have I learned from this?
        Well, quite a lot actually.
        On the surface it might not seem that much and I've also felt like making no progress at all.
        But I've done quite a lot of self-reflection and learning in the past two months.
        There is a thing called <em>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</em> which, in simple terms, focuses on how
        thoughts, feelings and behavior are connected.
        It sort of takes a scientific approach to psychology.
        And science and logic are right up my alley.
        I've been reading a lot about CBT and I've been trying to apply it to my life.
        Its main thing is called "cognitive distortions".
        Basically, it's a list of common thinking errors that people make.
        The goal is to identify these errors and then try to correct/challenge them.

        In a nutshell, you always have different ways of thinking about a situation.
        And thinking about it in a negative way will make you feel bad.
        So, if you can identify that you are thinking in a negative way, you can try to challenge that thought and
        think about it in a more positive way.
        This will then make you feel better.
        And, if you feel better, you will behave better.
        Sounds simple and straightforward, but it isn't.
        It takes a lot of practice and it's not easy to identify your own thinking errors.
        But after a while you get better at it and it really helps.

    <p>
        Now, let's round this post off.
        As stated in the beginning, I've been on holiday.
        Well, before that, I actually got sick for a week which wasn't the best experience.
        The holiday, however, was great.
        It was a gift from my parents for graduating from university.
        We spent five days, mostly in Switzerland.
        This, in fact, leads me to the future of this blog.
        Right now, it's only been about my mental struggles, mostly in chronological order.
        I've been thinking about writing about other things as well.
        So, here's the plan:
        The first tag of each post will indicate the category.
        All posts so far have been tagged with "Mental health".
        More general posts will be tagged with "General".
        And, posts about my travels will be tagged with "Travel".
        In the future, more categories might be added as needed.

        So, the next post will be about my holiday.
        As for the mental health stuff.
        Well...
        Since the main story came to a grinding halt at November last year, and the people that are involved in the
        current story are not on speaking terms with me, there's not much to write about.
        Well, there is <em>a lot</em> to write about, but I don't feel comfortable writing about it right now.
        There are more things that I do want to write about, including an already laid out post of the intermission
        flavour, as well as more content about CBT.
        So stay tuned for that.
    </p>

    <p>
        On that note, I'll end this post.
        Thanks for reading, as always.
        I want to do something fun at the end, which is a bit of a throwback to some of the first posts:
        A little bit of homework for you.
        Go ahead and reach out to someone who you hold dear and let them know that you care about them.
        It doesn't have to be anything big, just a simple "Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I care about you."
        Because you never know when you might lose them and close people are important.
        Also, on a similar note: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4kcczygOcw">Song recommendation!</a>
        Lastly, special thanks to A and S (male, first introduction) for being there for me.
        I have probably strained you more than you like to admit and I'm sorry for that.
        But I will be forever grateful for your support.
        And now, for real, bye bye!
    </p>
