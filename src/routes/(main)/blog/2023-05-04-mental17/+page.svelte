        Strap in (or I guess in regard to this topic: strap on?) - for another <em>very</em> personal post.
        It has been long enough, and it's finally the time to tackle this topic, despite all my discomfort and shame.
        Let's talk relationships and sex.
        This post will be split into three sections: romantic relationships, sexuality, platonic relationships.
        So, let's get started!
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have been following along these posts, then this will be old news.
        I have never been in a romantic relationship ever.
        What can I say - am just a sad lonely boi.
        I have attempted a relationship once, at least in the story so far anyway, and got rejected.
        As first teased way back then in <a href="/blog/2023-02-10-mental7/">7. Calm before the storm</a> I went through
        a similar situation rather recently.
        And spoiler (well, I said it before in a couple posts already): This, my overall second attempt at love, failed
        as well.
        For any "Baba is you" players, a little nerdy statement:
        I guess in my life somewhere there is the unmovable rule of "Love is defeat."
    </p>

    <p>
        But all of this is nothing I haven't already talked about.
        So why am I bringing this up again?
        In <a href="/blog/2023-02-26-mental11/">11. On the Subject of FOMO</a> I already talked about this stuff - what
        else is there to say?
        Well... one core topic that I explicitly did not talk about in that post.
        In fact, I stated that I would talk about it in a future post.
        This future post is now.
        And so, let's get this out of the way with:
        I have never been in a romantic relationship in my life - or even just otherwise close to someone else.
        As a male (in case you didn't know), I have never kissed a girl, and I am a virgin.
        Writing these words took no effort at all, but thinking about being almost 23 (at the time of writing) and never
        having experienced this stuff still makes me sad, insecure and ashamed.
        And rationally, I know that I shouldn't be - there is nothing wrong with me at all.
        But that does not change how my stupid brain thinks.
        I still struggle with self-worth from time to time - thinking that I need to get myself a girlfriend, or
        otherwise I will be alone forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe I have always just looked in the wrong places?
        Well, actually, I have never really looked for a relationship - that just doesn't make sense to me.
        So no wonder I have never been in one, if I'm just waiting for it to happen automatically.
        Kinda strange, ay?
        Well, we are already on the second part of this post now.
        What if me, a male, is simply not "made" to look for girlfriends.
        This sentence actually contains two viable information.
        Being made to <em>look for someone</em> and that someone <em>being female</em>.
        Well, hold on... but you wanted to be with a girl, right?
        You had feelings for her?
        Well, yes.
        But it's complicated.
        Growing up, there has always been a part in me that somehow was interested in the world and life of other boys.
        And I never thought something wrong about that.
        It seemed normal.
        And yet, it never really clicked.
        Until last year, 2022.
        Actually, at the time of writing, it was more or less a year ago that this thought-process started in my head.
        Couldn't have timed this better.
    </p>

    <p>
        But what exactly happened?
        With me having never been in a relationship, I stared to wonder if I simply am just not attracted to other
        people.
        In the world of sexual identities this is referred to as being aromantic/asexual, or AroAce for short.
        But I was attracted to someone in the past - how could that be?
        And I do find other people that I come across attractive.
        And I want a relationship.
        So clearly that cannot be it - right?
        Well, maybe I am attracted to males?
        That could be it!
        And back then, a year ago, a streamer I watched came out as gay.
        Maybe it was a sign?
        And so I played around with this thought for a few months.
        And yes: I can confirm that I do find men attractive and that I could definitely see myself in a homosexual
        relationship.
        So, case closed - all good.
        Sadly, not so fast.
        I eventually started coming out as gay at the end of the year.
        The story of this will be part of the next main-storyline post though, as this is quite important, since it
        sorta changed my life.
    </p>

    <p>
        So what happened after I started telling people that I am gay?
        I met another girl and developed feelings for her a month after.
        Amazing!
        To be honest, I wasn't 100% sure if I am actually gay or not.
        So maybe it wasn't the best choice.
        But as you will see in the main storyline, it definitely had a great positive impact on me - so I'd consider it
        a win.
        So I am not gay - sad.
        But what am I then?
        The next logical thing is biromantic/bisexual.
        I am definitely attracted to guys - but I do also feel attracted to girls (as my recent feelings have shown me).
        But something still didn't make sense.
        That's where the "looking for someone" part comes into play.
        There is something that's called demi-romantic/demisexual.
        What the heck does that mean now?
        Well, quite simple: I need to have an emotional connection to someone before feelings can develop.
        This means that I never felt actual attraction to others because I didn't know them.
        When my feelings for K developed, we were friends and have already gotten to know each other more.
        And the same thing happened recently: We befriended each other, and afterward feelings started to form.
        And so this leaves us with the following standing, which does feel right and makes a lot of sense to me:
        I am demi-bi - being attracted to guys and girls but only after I have already gotten to know them.
        I guess technically I could be pan-sexual (the non-binary version of bi, in simple terms).
        But if we go that far, then I'd say that I am "simply not straight" and call it a day.
    </p>

    <p>
        And now onto some platonic love!
        Because, while I have never been in love - or romantic relationship - I feel a lot of love towards my friends.
        Platonic love, that is.
        And with my sexuality explained - platonic and romantic love are quite similar for me.
        The latter is just more exclusive and includes stuff like kissing and intimacy.
        But where one ends and the other begins is something very individual and depends on the people involved.
        For me, the line is very blurry it seems like.
        I don't know completely, as this is very new for me.
        The main-storyline posts following this post will cover this in more detail.
        But let me spoil you with this: The friendships I am currently in have been absolutely incredible.
        I didn't know that I could feel so loved and appreciated by others.
    </p>

    <p>
        One thing in particular that I want to address here is the line between friends and lovers.
        Nowadays, a boy and girl cannot be physically close together without being labeled a couple.
        And if two boys were just remotely close to each other, then they certainly have to be gay.
        But if two girls were to hold hands and stroll through the city, then they are just besties.
        Very stereotypical and stupid.
        Why can't people just like each other in a non-romantic way and do stuff together without needing to worry about
        this perception?
        Well, that's what I am here to talk about and fight against.
        I am a very physical person - I like being close to someone else.
        It gives me comfort and makes me feel welcomed and appreciated.
        So I am happy to say that I now have close friends that I can cuddle with from time to time.
        Because cuddling is fun!
        Of course, there is a difference between friends cuddling and partners cuddling.
        But it can be done without immediately needing to be in a romantic relationship.
        And friends can also hold hands if they feel like it - not a partner exclusive.
        But even with everything I have written now, it still would make me feel a bit weird if I cuddled with a guy.
        I am attracted to guys, yes.
        But every guy I know is straight, and with that in mind, it just feels weird thinking about that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Last transition in this post then.
        Openly talking about any of this stuff is very uncommon - at least in my experience.
        It is never talked about platonic relationships and the stuff that goes alongside them - like I mentioned above.
        Sex is not often a thing that is talked about seriously - only dirty jokes are being made.
        And I am not saying that I am any better - I constantly make these jokes myself.
        But it isn't a safe and comfortable environment to be open about this stuff - especially when you're insecure
        about it.
        And so I want to end this post by wishing that everyone could be more open and serious about this stuff.
        At the end of the day, relationships and sex(uality) are a very private thing and shouldn't be the concern of
        anyone else.
        Those things should only concern you.
        But if these topics wouldn't be so uncomfortable to talk about, maybe the world could just be a better place.

        And now, for real, this post is over.
        What a long wall of text it is.
        I think I have now openly covered everything I wanted to cover and talk about.
        Of course, apart from the things that I will talk about in the next few posts.
        Thanks for reading, maybe there was something interesting in here.
        Anyway, see you next time, have a great one!
