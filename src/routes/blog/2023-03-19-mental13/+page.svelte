        Ah yes, the smell of a fresh blog post.
        If you pay attention to the publish-dates, you may notice that I have been on another blogging break.
        It has been quite busy, but I finally got the time and motivation to crank out another glorious amalgamation of
        words.
        This post is not just a fresh installment in this series but also marks a new era in my life: University.
        This has been a game changer for me.
        My mental health has drastically improved since starting my bachelor's.
        Spoiler: Some of this is due to the fact that I successfully hid my struggles again for a while, as you will
        find out in later posts.
        But for the most part, I actually improved a lot, which is nice!
        So, now let's start with how I got into university.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our story begins with a throwback to 2019.
        I had secured a place to serve my civil service, starting in september of that year.
        Or so I thought...
        After filling out all the forms and having an in-person meeting with my future boss, I was happy.
        However, I never got an official confirmation.
        So I decided, in between of all the studying for the final exams, to write an e-mail about the status of my
        application.
        And I actually got a response back fairly quickly, stating that everything is fine.
        So I graduated from school and went on our post-graduation trip to Croatia.
        And on the second day I received a call from my soon-to-be boss where he told me that I will not be working as a
        civil servant for him.
        The reason was that "another person has been accepted before, and we overlooked that."
        I call it nepotism.
        But whatever actually happened behind the scenes, I was devastated, to say the least.
        This was the first piece of the puzzle that led me to university.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moving on...
        After coming back home, one of my family members got ill and had to go to the hospital.
        There they were accompanied by a young worker.
        While talking, it was mentioned that this worker was in fact a civil servant, working directly for the hospital.
        Since we had some contacts within the hospital, we asked around and yes, they accept civil servants.
        The catch: The next open spot is january, meaning that I have half a year that's wasted.
        How I spent that half-year is documented in
        <a href="/blog/2023-02-19-mental10/">10. Take a look in the mirror, youâ€™ll see a bit clearer</a>.
        Also, if you are interested in my experience as a civil servant in the hospital, you can read about it here:

    </p>

    <p>
        So now it is early july 2019.
        Through a family member, I got a position as an intern at my city's town hall.
        I would work in August as an intern in the public relations department.
        There I was responsible for writing articles for the city's newspaper and website.
        Of course, I also had to do boring intern work as well.
        A colleague noticed that I was quite good and I had a lot of knowledge in this field.
        They then recommended me a study program at my local university.
        Another piece of the puzzle placed down.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had a look on the university's website, and while the study program seemed interesting, there were a few
        lectures that absolutely did not interest me.
        Combined with my disinterest in studying, I decided that this was not for me.
        After a few months passed, I looked again, and it suddenly seemed a bit more compelling.
        It turned out that they reworked the curriculum, and I noticed.
        And so, after a bit more thinking and hesitation, I decided to apply.
        Fast-forward and I got accepted.
        But there is another catch: The start of university would overlap for a couple of weeks with the end of my civil
        service.
        Thankfully, we were able to find a solution for that.
        And with this roller coaster out of the way, we are now in september 2020, and I am at university.
    </p>

    <p>
        I do not believe in the supernatural or anything like that.
        But this story deepens one of my believes: Everything happens for a reason.
        No matter how good or bad something was, there is always something to learn and take away from any experience.
        And everything that has happened in your life in the way that it did plays a huge part in defining who you are.
        And we will see that, as hinted at previously, in some future posts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, onto university.
        To quickly summarize the first two semesters: It was the absolute best choice to apply!
        I really like the environment, the people around me and the stuff we learn.
        Of course, not everything is always that interesting, but if that would be the case, then I'd say that I'm
        dreaming.
        One of the first confidence boosts was the class representation election.
        Basically, every "class" (110 people in our case) gets its own representative.
        Well, actually up to three or five, depending on the size of the class.
        And after a bit of hesitation, if I should apply, I did.
        We even launched a small and fun voting campaign.
        Needless to say: I won.
        There was only one other contestant, however, so it was not the most difficult election.
        Being appreciated and accepted in this way was extremely helpful for me and my mental health.
    </p>

    <p>
        With new people also come new chances.
        I embraced all my decisions against alcohol and the like (see <a href="/blog/2023-02-26-mental11/">11. On the
        Subject of FOMO</a>) and just was myself.
        And, who'd guessed it: Everyone was totally fine with that.
        No judgement or anything like that.
        Can't life always be that simple?
        One downside to mention here is that I still lacked in the friends department.
        As a lot of the lectures were held online due to Covid-19, there weren't a lot of opportunities
        to get to know each other on a more personal level.
        And because I was socially stimulated enough by just hanging about in person, I did not feel the desire to
        actually make friends.
        Now, after the fact, there are two people to mention here: A & C, male.
        With me being stupid and not feeling like someone is my friend for a long time, it makes sense that I thought
        that I was alone.
        But these two have definitely been there for me!
        With A, who moved to the city at the beginning of the second semester, I hung out with him a lot, since he did
        not know that many people at first after moving.
        And C is a whole other topic for himself.
        But to just quickly summarize: He is one of the greatest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet and work
        with!
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of the second semester, I started working as a part-time assistant for the university.
        Another great decision of mine because at the time of writing,
        I still work there, and it has been an absolute pleasure so far!
    </p>

    <p>
        Alright, that's all about the beginning of university.
        Pretty positive and uplifting, ay?
        Well, not so fast, little one.
        Next time around, we are taking another step back in the mental health department.
        But, at the time of writing, this will be the last major setback for now.
        After that, it is mostly uphill, with only a few local setbacks and sad moments.
        And, of course, we will still be exploring some overarching topics that don't fit into the chronological main
        storyline, that are a bit sadder as well.
        But now enough foreshadowing.
        Take care, until next time!
