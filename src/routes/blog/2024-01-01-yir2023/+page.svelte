        New year, old me.
        Yeah, what did you think would happen?
        Ain't nothing gonna change just because the year did.
        New years is just a regular day for me.
        But since it does mark an extremely important change for almost everyone else
        (yes, a lot of people consider writing down the wrong year for a few weeks an important change),
        I thought "heck, why not, let's do a short review of last year".
        And so here we are.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not gonna make this long and go into detail.
        You can go through the posts yourself.
        Now, they all have a 2023 tag, so in the future, you can easily filter by year.
        Aren't I nice?
        The very very <i>very</i> brief summary of 2023: A shit ton happened.
        Normally, you'd pick out your favourite memory / moment and talk a bit about it.
        For me, it funnily has always been easier to pick out the most negative memory / moment.
        And so, if you want to read about the worst part of my 2023, then go ahead:
        <a href="/blog/2023-08-01-general1/">Where I've been</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway.
        I thought a bit about what my favourite memory / moment of 2023 could be.
        And a few came to mind and I am always bad at picking <i>the</i> best thing.
        One highlight though was my Switzerland trip, especially being on top of the mountains at the Jungfraujoch.
        I even printed out one of the panorama photos I took and hung it up at home.
        So, if you want a brief overview of that holiday, then <a href="/blog/2023-08-13-travel1/">Trip to
        Switzerland</a> has got you covered.
        Otherwise, there were loads and loads of fun moments with friends and colleagues.
        And, of course, I cannot forget to stress how much I am grateful for the few, but extremely close, friends I
        have had the honor of spending loads of time with in 2023.
        If you read this, you know who you are.
        Love you!

        Now onto a finisher of the year, since I haven't written in a few months.
        Not that much has been going on actually.
        I was sick twice, with a week's break in between.
        Cannot recommend.
        Otherwise, December has been worse again with my mental health.
        It probably has something to do with winter, because I spend most of my time inside.
        Oh precious sun, where are you.
        Christmas time was as usual, but I got a lot of Lego (mostly from myself, because I wanted bigger, more
        expensive sets) and oh my god did I miss building Lego.
        Another gift to myself: I am moving out for the first time.
        I'm not on track to my own apartment just yet, but I am moving into a shared flat at my university's students
        dorm, where one of the rooms will be free soon.
        And then I'll be living with a friend of mine.
        It is a bit scary to actually move out from my parents' home, but I am <i>very</i> excited.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, I do want to document my very sad finish of the year.
        December 31st was not a great day.
        I was feeling down and I was alone at night.
        My parents were out and about.
        Then, suddenly it kicked in quite fast.
        My mind was full of negative thoughts and I also felt a bit angry at everything.
        I had a lot of bad thoughts about my friends and if they even care about me and like me.
        I thought if it was even worth my time to be friends with them.
        And so on, and so forth.
        I was in a very bad place.
        I was crying a lot.
        And, for a brief moment, I was thinking about self-harm again.
        But, I was able to gather myself at least a little bit and reached out to someone.
        I expected that they aren't going to respond until the next day, but it felt good to let off some steam.
        I then cried myself to sleep.
        A bit after midnight, I woke up and felt very sick.
        I was on the brink of throwing up.
        After some time, it got a bit better and I fell asleep again.
        And that concludes my 2023, as it is now already 2024 in my story.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, what's next?
        First of all, one more week of winter break.
        Then it's back to university and grinding on all projects to finish them on time until the end of the month.
        As for the bigger picture.
        I do not have anything concrete planned for the year yet.
        My overall goal is just to be a better version of myself, day by day.
        I want to be more open about my feelings and thoughts.
        I want to be more honest with myself and others.
        I want to be more confident in myself.
        And so on.
        Will I achieve all of that?
        God knows.
        But I will try.
        And I hope you will too.
        Have a great 2024!
    </p>
