        First year of university done, two to go.
        But first, it is time for summer break.
        Actually, I do you even one better: We start a bit before that.
        It is the last week of june 2021.
        All exams have been successfully taken - well, all but one.
        This semester I took an extra certification course which partially took part in the last week of june.
        There we had the final exam needed for the certification.
        While I did succeed and therefore was able to finish this semester for good, in a very positive way, I noticed
        something.
        My mental health started to decline again - mostly from a few stressful weeks and a lot of social contact.
        After being home alone due to covid, this semester had more lectures on-campus again - especially near the end,
        towards summer.
        This meant that I had an unusual amount of in-person contact which took a bit of getting used to.
        I had noticed my declining state rather quickly and knew that I had to do something about it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why, you might ask.
        In general, because it's shitty to feel bad.
        But in this case, because a week later, a group of seven from university (this includes me) went on a trip to
        Amsterdam.
        This meant more socializing and also exposure to a new environment.
        The first day will forever be remembered dearly in my heart.
        We got up at 2:30 in the night (I think I only slept like half an hour) to collect some of the crew along the
        way to the airport.
        Everyone was more awake than I thought - especially me given the amount of sleep I had.
        At noon, when we had lunch, everyone thought that it was already late in the afternoon.
        All day we were just joking around and laughing about the smallest, unfunniest things with our remaining energy
        and braincells.
        However, things changed on the second day.
        It was my birthday, and you must know that I have never (well, actually once in 2019) celebrated my birthday.
        Never having friends and also having a birthday during the summer break meant that there wasn't anyone around to
        celebrate with.
        And so I just grew up kinda hating my birthday and being a bit grumpy about it.
        But, future me speaking, I think that this is slowly changing now, which is nice.
        I still don't want any presents tho and a party or something like that.
        Maybe just chilling with friends or going on a day-trip and <em>maybe</em> getting one or two tiny gifts would
        be nice.
        But I am drifting from the story.
    </p>

    <p>
        The day started out pretty chill and nice - we went to the Rijksmuseum.
        After that we got some food and went on a shopping tour.
        This was breaking point number one for me: I don't like shopping.
        So I just followed around and waited outside the shops.
        In hindsight, I could have just entered and at least have a small look around and continue talking to the others
        rather than just waiting outside.
        At least A also wasn't that interested and kept me company most of the time.
        Fast-forward to the end of the day.
        After going to our hotel, we decided to take another small walk to a nearby park.
        This was very pleasant, we also played around on the playground like small children.
        After that it was already about 23:00, and I was ready for bed.
        The others, however, wanted to go back to the city center.
        My offer, that I could just go back to the hotel alone was shut down.
        And so I was dragged along.
        This made me upset, and I stopped talking to them - again, like a small child.
        I guess the playground session wasn't too far-fetched then.
        We wandered around in the city center without a concrete plan of what to do.
        The mood shifted towards everyone being down because of me.
        I rationally knew that this was completely stupid and that I should just speak up and let it go.
        But I just couldn't - I was unable to do so.
        This is something that I got from my mother - thanks for that!
    </p>

    <p>
        With the second day coming to a close, the scene was set for the other three days.
        While they were mostly more positive, I was still in my own head for being known as the "upset crazy kid."
        Again, rationally, I knew how stupid this was, but I couldn't let it go.
        On the last night, when I tried to sleep already and the others were extremely loud while playing card games, I
        almost snapped.
        I have kept this to myself up until today, but I finally have to share this with others.
        I had serious thoughts about getting out of bed, taking something heavy like a chair and threatening the others
        with it to make them go to bed.
        This was how upset and frustrated I was with myself and the entire situation.
        I can't remember another moment in my life when I felt this way.
        I am glad that I did not actually proceed with this plan.
        In the end, the Netherlands and Amsterdam and this entire trip were amazing,
        and I will forever be deeply sorry for making it worse for everyone.

        Moving on from this roller coaster.
        Recovering mentally in july led me to starting a cool project.
        As mentioned in <a href="/blog/2023-02-09-mental6/">6. A small glimpse of hope</a> I started writing or at least
        thinking about making my own music.
        I now had a more concrete idea and started working on a new album.
        Its titel song, that I wrote in about two hours that night in july, and the album itself are called "Off My
        Mind".
        Pretty fitting, ay?
        There are even some references to some lyrics in this blog. The titles
        from <a href="/blog/2023-02-05-mental2/">2. An insignificant person in an insignificant town</a>
        and <a href="/blog/2023-02-19-mental10/">10. Take a look in the mirror, youâ€™ll see a bit clearer</a>
        are both lines in the first song of the album called "Exposed".
        At the time of writing, the album consists of 8 songs, 5 of which are fully written.
        I already have melodies for all songs in my head as well.
        And that's enough spoilers for now.
    </p>

        Moving along to the end of August.
        I have mentioned him a couple of times, but now it is his time to shine.
        I am talking about non-other than Cavetown.
        After stumbling upon one of his songs by accident while listening to music while building my new PC, I
        immediately fell in love with his music.
        I went through his whole discography in chronological order - something that I don't think I have done before at
        that point.
        Of course, I don't like every single song of his, but damn do I like almost all of them.
        With his genre being mostly indie-pop/rock and his songs mostly about his mental health struggles,
        and the like, it was an instant hit for me.
        So much so, that I did another unheard of thing, at least for me.
        One month after discovering him, I joined his fanclub.
        Due to having a lot going on in real life, I sadly can't participate that much, but it is an extremely lovely
        and welcoming community.
        His discovery also led me to something else, but I'll leave that for the next main-storyline post.
        Spoiler: It is really cool!
    </p>

    <p>
        I finished off this year with my brother moving out.
        This meant two things for me:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>I got to have his room as my second room/office</li>
        <li>Maybe there would finally be peace in this household</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        While the first was and still is really cool, the latter sadly did not come true.
        My mother and brother always used to argue and have discussions and be mad at each other.
        So I had the big hope that with him being gone that things would get better.
        But that was certainly not the case.
        Now my mother moved on to doing all the same things, just with my dad.
        And let me tell you: After having a long day at university, the last thing you want to have is coming home to
        parents who are fighting.
        This is especially true if you aren't doing too well mentally.
        I will go a bit more into detail about some struggles in the next post, which will be another one of the
        intermission flavour.
    </p>

    <p>
        And with that we have another blog post finished.
        After the intermission post, we will continue our main storyline with the absolute best year in my life so far.
        I really did not lie when I said that 2021 was the last major set-back, at least at the time of writing.
        So, see ya!
    </p>
